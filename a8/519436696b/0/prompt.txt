I'm working remotly and have ssh'ed in here. the system uses 1password to manage ssh keys so none are on disk. are we able to git pull working around this current limitation

---

lets do the gh auth setup-git route

---

cool, can you look at the oauth proxy and tell me how it works at a high level

---

that is interesting, so the admin api ... how does one interact with that?

---

sounds pretty well thought out and implemented. can we see if theres any accounts in there

---

you can swap the kubectl auth to the on disk config for the mcp. i think its at ~/.config/kubectl mcp something like that. actually you can see it in ~/.claude/plugins/cache/omni-scale/

---

well lets do it

---

lets review repo docs and make sure everything is updated properly before we commit it all

---

send it

---

lets verify ci cleared

---

check rool out

---

i thought we just fixed that via kustomization.yaml

---

isn't the proper fix:  Migrate from configmap.yaml as a resource to configMapGenerator in kustomization.yaml — then any config change automatically gets a new hash suffix, which changes the pod spec, which triggers a rollout
